This is the readme for the model for the papers:

1. Riera J, Hatanaka R, Ozaki T, Kawashima R (2011) Modeling the
spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes: Inconsistencies and
usefulness. J Integr Neurosci 10:439-73

2. Riera J, Hatanaka R, Uchida T, Ozaki T, Kawashima R (2011)
Quantifying the uncertainty of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in
astrocytes: particulars of Alzheimer's disease. Biophys J 101:554-64

3. Manninen T, Havela R, Linne ML (2017) Reproducibility and
comparability of computational models for astrocyte calcium
excitability Front. Neuroinform.

This jupyter notebook was contributed by Dr T Manninen.

We implemented and ran the model by Riera et al. (2011) using Jupyter
Notebook. Model codes produce results of Figures 1 and 2 in Manninen,
Havela, Linne (2017). To run, start jupyter notebook on your system
and load the ipython notebook.

The Riera2011_Ca_free_constant.ipynb code in its second subplot
produces traces similar to figure 4 in the Riera et al
J. Int. Neuro. 2011:
